You may ***never***:

- sell our hacks in any way shape or form
- hide our hacks behind a paywall/subscribewall of any kind
  - This includes adf.ly 😐
- use our hacks to leak private information
- use our hacks to steal user login information or tokens
- claim ownership of our hacks (Just stop bragging about it 😠)
- modify it slightly just to add your own ads 🤨

If you're gonna talk about our hacks (on YouTube or other social media platforms), please please pretty please [credit us properly](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking/blob/master/YOUTUBE_ATTRIBUTION.md).

It hurts our souls when skids take credit for our hacks and don't even link us.
